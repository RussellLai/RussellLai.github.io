    it also gave me valuable insights and inspirations for my final project. 
What were the challenging parts of this lab?
    The challenging part of this lab for me is the interaction. I had some
    issues figuring out which part of the code should be placed in which

What resources did you use? Include links to websites below
    The main resources I used are the lab guide and past labs to remind me 
    the codes of doing the things we have learned, and I also asked some of
    my friends when I am having troubles understanding the code or debugging.
